	Modern agricultural, biological, and biomedical instrumentation uses electronic sensors, analog and digital</p><p>circuits, computers and microcontrollers for scientific measurements and process control. Instrumentation</p><p> is used widely for commercial product development, testing, and basic research.</p>
	<p>With the coming of the Industrial Revolution and the development of more complicated machines, farming</p><p>methods took a great leap forward.[1] Instead of harvesting grain by hand with a sharp blade, wheeled</p><p> machines cut a continuous swath. Instead of threshing the grain by beating it with sticks, threshing</p><p> machines separated the seeds from the heads and stalks. The first tractors appeared in the late 19th century.</p>
